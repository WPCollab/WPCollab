caramiame

yoren

3
yes
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
yes
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
How about we move the document to Google Drive and collaborate on it now?
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
I am not particularly fond of Google services but it sound like a good idea
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
i have it open in my browser to refer to
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
That works
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
I’ll do it.
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
ok thank josh
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
In the meanwhile, @caramiame it is the first time to join us, welcome!
Shelob9
• February 17 2014

Shoot, it looses all formatting when I paste to google docs
caramiame

Hello Emoji-
Released to WPORG
our release process needs to be automated. We can use one of my servers (Git, PHP, whatever we need) [@cfoellmann]
Next version: What bug fixes are needed? What ideas on the future releases milestone or other things should we do?
TinyMCE plugin
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
let me update the file before anyone adds something
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
k
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
let me breif the first onoe
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
OK. I made @cfoellmann an editor of the doc since I have his email. Let’s get started already 6 after.
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
k
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
ok
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
May I know if @caramiame is a front end developer?
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
yes
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
perfect
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
[:blush:]
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
good. we're trying to deal with the tinyMCE plugin
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
do you have any experience on it? Hello Emoji doesn't support TinyMCE for now
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
Here is the future releases milestone: https://github.com/WPCollab/hello-emoji/issues?milestone=3&state=open&state=closed
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
i sent a link over weekend about guy who did some work with that
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
i'll try to find
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
https://github.com/WPCollab/hello-emoji/issues?milestone=3&page=1&state=open
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
great
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
so let me assign this issue to you
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
Is there anything else we really want to do with Hello Emoji besides that?
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
I think that is the scope for the plugin. Maybe we can think about good actions/filters to allow devs to extend the fields where emojis are activated
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
i found this may be ahead but it would help with deployment and also other stuff you guys are building: https://github.com/benbalter/Github-to-WordPress-Plugin-Directory-Deployment-Script
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
done. Now @caramiame gets her first job
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
k
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
have @Shelob9 mentioned that script before?
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
I agree with @cfoellmann that what wer have + TinyMCE support is good enough for Hello Emoji
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
Right I use a similar script.
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
I think @cfoellmann will work on the automated deployment work
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
right?
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
i don't think so it is by ben balter who also has a document management gig i've used
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
plug in
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
It’s good but not as good as what @cfoellmann is looking to do.
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
k
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
There are a ton of versions of that script floating about.
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
yes. webhook sounds a much better idea
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
right
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
let me add the "action/filter" part to the issue.
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
That’s getting into Plugin Skelton discusssion.
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
The webhook will start the script that will be some variation of one of these shell scripts
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
Do we have anything else on Hello Emoji before we go there?
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
If not, can @yoren or @cfoellmann give an update on where we are at with that project?
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
did it get fixed for auto install
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
i can ftp -- just wondered
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
one more thing about hello emoji
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
I thing we should rewrite the js files
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
Ours or the included libraries?
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
included and ours
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
@caramiame do you mean the issue https://github.com/WPCollab/hello-emoji/issues/65
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
they're all small scripts
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
yoren -- what was it?
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
too many http requests if we seperate theme
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
@yoren I agree. Good use for grunt, to build to one minifed version.
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
We could Grunt the assets together as soon as we have a little more exp with GruntJS
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
you could take a look at the js files
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
https://github.com/WPCollab/hello-emoji/tree/master/js
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
I think no need to use 3 files for it
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
Let’s add that, and TinyMCE to 0.2 milestone then.
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
grunt to merge them is okay, but I suggest we should rewrite the files too
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
What needs rewritten?
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
could anyone confirm the https://github.com/WPCollab/hello-emoji/issues/65 fatal error? I can not reproduce it
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
I can not confirm that error.
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
I can't reproduce it too. Tried today
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
you guys did wp auto install or ftp of plugin? it happened twice for me once on multisite install and once on single install
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
i'll try real quick
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
https://github.com/WPCollab/hello-emoji/blob/master/js/hello-emoji-textcomplete.js and https://github.com/WPCollab/hello-emoji/blob/master/js/admin.js. there are a variable to define the emojis
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
I don’t want to debug this in the middle of the meeting.
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
they are duplicated
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
Let’s add issues to Hello Emoji 0.2 milestone and move on.
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
I tried "all" ways. directly from the wp.org and ftp works for me
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
I've install it on my multisite, it seemed fine
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
let me add the issue
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
@yoren please do.
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
One for improving code quality.
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
Fatal error: Class 'WPCollab_HelloEmoji_Admin' not found in /home/shirleyw/public_html/wp-content/plugins/hello-emoji/hello-emoji.php on line 101 this is shared hosting single install
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
One for grunt to combine and minify.
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
One for TinyMCE
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
One for rewrite JS files
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
should we skip 0.1.1
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
Well someone added a 0.2 milestone, really should be 0.1.1
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
Rename it.
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
ok
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
if the error is not reproducible it is not a patch release
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
so what @Shelob9 said
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
i just reproduced it -- is there some feature the shared host should have active for it in php?
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
@cfoellmann ‘rewrite JS’ combines two issues, code quality (ie duplicate variables) and combining and minifying.
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
Quick question: is there a chat protocol here for gitter?
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
so those issues should be in 0.1.1?
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
@yoren Yes.
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
ok
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
no these are improvements and not patches so 0.2
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
ha
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
ok let's go 0.2
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
@cfoellmann yah...
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
make more sense
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
? what about error
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
line 101
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
@caramiame Can we debug that later please and stay focused on the agenda right now?
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
ok
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
milestone 0.2:https://github.com/WPCollab/hello-emoji/issues?milestone=5&state=open
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
4 issues
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
@yoren Looks good.
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
this would be 0.1.1 patch but I am not sure it is a problem with the plugin. L101 is the init for the admin class. error is because the file seems to be missing on your system - lets talk about @caramiame it after chat if you got time
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
ok
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
k
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
Let's move on.
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
I agree.
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
@yoren or @cfoellmann can you give an update on where the plugin skelton project is please?
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
I'll let @cfoellmann do it
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
Besides deciding on build tools and testing tools what else needs done?
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
just like @yoren said it is not ready to be used, yet. I just dropped in all the things we used and did not refresh the build process completely.
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
you talked about a downloader like underscores
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
first it will be a GruntJS "package" (whatever it will be called) for everyone to init a new project locally.
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
I think the underscores idea is great but we may not do it in the near future, right?
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
k
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
It is more or less running the GruntJS online and not locally.
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
k
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
Let me open an issue for the underscores idea
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
So what are the steps left for finishing that project and making it a useable start point for other projects?
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3

    make the skeleton work with a definedGruntJS environement

caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
design front end for running the GruntJS online eventually
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
probably goes with theme
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
right?
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
landing page with backend for project collaberation
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
I think @cfoellmann means how the plugin skeleton to be generated as plugin files
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
right. some kind of landing page for wpcollab.co
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
oh. you're talking about the underscores part?
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
i know -- [:blush:]
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
wpcollab.co is I going to be a proper website for this effort, but let’s discuss that later.
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
@caramiame that is the underscores part
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
k
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
We will need to map this generator to a subdomain or a sub directory.
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
ok. I've opened that issue: https://github.com/WPCollab/wpcollab-plugin-skeleton/issues/13
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
k
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
I will fix the template.js today/tomorrow and will write up all the "services/daemons" need to run locally for it to work
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
great
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
did some tests today but keep fail
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
I will also have a look at VVV if it can run the Grunt process so the host system does not need everything installed
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
Thanks @cfoellmann. let me check later when you get it done.
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
You mean a whole vagrant box, jsut for this.
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
@yoren I was just hacking away on the template,js without testing to document all references
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
ok. I figured that out
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
so anything else for skeleton?
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
@Shelob9 VVV is pretty popular and if it only takes a little sh plus a provision to make the VM a Grunt machine that will be nice
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
i'm new to it so i will learn about it
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
Well I’d think you’d want to add this to an exisiting vagrant box.
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
I think the skeleton it pretty complete when it can run without a hickup. Major issue is the autoloader. PSR-0/4 are breaking with WP php coding standards so we have to decide to go against PHP best practices or WP code styling best practices
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
hmm. If we have to choose, I'll choose WP style
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
Doesn’t one or both break PHP 5.2 compatibility?
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
We sadly need to keep that.
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
I agree with what @yoren said.
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
@cfoellmann are you okay with it?
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
can you bridge the code somehow to handle both and get through it?
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
or impossible
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
Actually I rely on @cfoellmann's judgment as long us he could make the skeleton work.
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
i have no idea
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
@yoren I would rather break naming conventions than the best practices of the coding language. Major issue here for standard is the usage of _ underscores in the WP code style which is the global indicator for another level of a namespace
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
scratch that
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
i mean my ?
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
@Shelob9 none these things break 5.2 compatibility although I would love it if both would
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
It has to support 5.2, WordPress does.
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
yeah. we support 2 PHP version that are not maintained
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
right
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
hmm... sounds a difficult decision. Could you figure this out later? or what we could do to help on this?
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
WordPress supports 5.2, like it or not.
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
I don’t but we don’t get to decide.
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
Andrew Nacin and Matt Mullenwig are pretty firm on that.
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
doesnt mean plugins have to, too [:imp:]
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
@Shelob9 I sent a request to be the editor of Google Doc
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
@yoren Already aproved.
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
@cfoellmann But a huge percentage of users are on hosts that are running 5.2.
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
I had a graph awhile back, it is horrifying, but true.
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
If we release non 5.2 compatible code, we will be getting reports of fatal errors.
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
right not good
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
[:blush:]
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
yeah. here in taiwan, tons of hosting still support only php 5.2.17
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
ok. lets stop this. 5.2 is not the problem here
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
ok
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
k
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
Compatibility with it is a big deal to me.

so you'll deal with the autoloader, right?
yoren
• February 17 2014

I'm not sure what is the "19" for?
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
is it a namespace or something?
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
i have no idea
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
i can find out
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
no it is a stupid copy&paste screwup
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
ok
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
Let’s move on then.
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
k
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
Let me give a brief overview of where we are at with wpcollab.co and then we can discuss moving on to new projects.
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
We still have no idea how to do the autoloader
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
oh
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
you need us check out the code?
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
classes folder is the problem. it is non PSR compatible
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
I don't quite understand why not
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
but if we use class names like WPCollabPluginName and load classes from /PluginName folder it is not using underlines and is not WP code style
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
The folder should named like "Hello_Emoji"?
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
here's a link on drupal, https://drupal.org/node/1320394
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
structure like "Hello_Emoji/Admin.php"?
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
let us look into it more
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
can not because that indicates Hello/Emoji.php
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
oh
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
your example to Hello\Emoji\Admin.php
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
http://www.sitepoint.com/battle-autoloaders-psr-0-vs-psr-4/ i will research
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
We can drop our prefix WPCollab but need to work with camalNames for the folders
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
Why drop the prefix?
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
May I know don't follow psr-0 will break anything? or just for the best practice?
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
Without namespaces, wouldn’t we run the risk of clashing class name?
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
@yoren has a good point?
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
i'm just looking into it -- if i find something based on this chat i let you know
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
Drop it in the autoloader function so we do not have an additional folder depth for the classes
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
PSR-0 should be used so users who run their sites with composer do not run into issues
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
PSR-0 calls for \<Vendor Name>(<Namespace>)*<Class Name> right?
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
can i print this chat?
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
you mean now? or later
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
later
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
lets get to this topic again in the issue on GItHub over the week
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
surely
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
yes
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
@caramiame that was what I was asking too. Any kind of chat protocol somewhere?
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
can't find a way to do so
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
just print
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
it will load on mine...
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
Can we move on then.
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
i'll check into it
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
k
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
@Shelob9 yes
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
1c) please
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
I suppose you could copy and paste the chat script [:wink:]
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
@Shelob9 please
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
OK briefly on wpcollab.co then
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
landing page with back end project mgt
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
I set up with Pods and a small plugin a system where we have custom fields on pages that are children of the page people.
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
yes I've filled my info
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
great!
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
It pulls from the users object which is extended to add wporg username/ twitter and github.
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
Also I have a projects CPT that is related to those pages to list contributors.
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
All of the output is handled by this little plugin I wrote: https://github.com/WPCollab/wpcollab-pods-plugin
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
yes. I'll find a time to learn about the pods. It looks good.
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
Eveyrone is author of their own page, put whatever you want in the content of your page.
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
yes. got it
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
Right now we need two things:
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
1) Pick a better theme.
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
2) Add style to make the custom fields look right with it (https://github.com/WPCollab/wpcollab-pods-plugin/tree/master/css)
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
k
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
ok the theme part.
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
We also need to decide what type of posts we shoudl start making there (ie news) instead of on make.wpcollab.co
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
@caramiame are you a designer too?
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
yes
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
Also we need to discuss who posts on wpcollab.co blog to avoid things getting messy.
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
Would you recommend any ready-made theme or you'd like do a custom one for the team?
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
i think a project management system
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
I’m super busy so I don’t have time to work on it or I’d do the theme to.
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
Is it possible that I do not have the rights to set my profile for my "People" page?
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
@caramiame this is not for project managment.
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
oh. not yet, we're still in a theme for the website
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
@cfoellmann Yah, I can fill in your info for you.
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
If anyone is super keen on creating a new theme for it, ok. But we should modify something
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
I agree with @cfoellmann I’d rather just customize something existing.
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
i've got stuff
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
Honestly we could just stick with 2014, if we put a little work into the css for the custom fields.
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
k
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
@caramiame could you recommend some nice themes for us?
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
Slobodon and I have been working on the do as little as possible philosophy for wpcollab.co
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
yes -- i have several i could recommend
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
ok great
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
i'd like to find out what we are doing for the online collaberation
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
I'll open an issue on GitHub for the theme
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
@caramiame If you want to recomend a theme and then do a PR on that plugin with the styles for getting the custom fields to look like, that would be great.
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
k
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
@caramiame We will get to that.
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
there was an image that had a gray background i saw -- is that a look and feel you like?
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
What image?
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
it was in an older post you guys were back and forth about the theme and then there was a group of guys you really like their theme...
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
someone uploaded something
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
Do you have a link? I’m not sure what you’re talking about.
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
i went to look and didn't have time to retrieve
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
i'll share later it is in the wpcollab discussions
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
@caramiame are you talking about our P2?
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
don't know
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
Beacuse p2 is seprate from this.
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
the theme is for another site, our offical one
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
don't know
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
have to find it
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
moving on
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
Yes please.
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
[:blush:]
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
just open an issue here: https://github.com/WPCollab/wpcollab-pods-plugin/issues/1. Let's put some candidate themes there. okay?
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
k
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
@yoren Awesome.
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
Let’s discusss the blog on wpcollab.co
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
Then move on.
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
ok
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
Should we use that for status updates or just for release announcments or what?
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
hallo
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
oh. jsut a test. got disconnected
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
ok
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
uncategorized posts for status updates categorized posts back end
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
I think the official blog should be used to any "official announcement".
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
@yoren what would constitute an “official announcement”?
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
k --
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
So things like meeting time notice, could stay on the P2.
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
unstructured discussions and communication on the p2 and "blog" posts on the site
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
wpcollab is proud to announce
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
So just we’ve released a new plugin or update to plugin?
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
yeah. If we just release a new plugin, it should be announce on the blog
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
yes and public announcements of any kind
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
we could just leave a link on P2
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
or multisite it
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
P2 is for the brainstorming thing
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
Right.
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
@caramiame This is not replacing the p2.
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
brainstorm, communication, link sharing
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
and we should write a few small "field reports" for the site on how we did something
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
make.wpcollab.co stays where it is, unaltered.
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
@cfoellmann Good idea.
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
like Finding a proper Autoloader [:wink2:]
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
i know
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
@cfoellmann lol
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
[:smile:]
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
OK I think we basically agree.
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
Let’s move on, but keep in mind that this has gone on for an hour now.
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
should I open an issue on this?
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
@yoren What’s the issue?
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
the decision on what goes to blog?
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
it's not a issue though.
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
I think that is something for P2
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
an open discussion
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
ok
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
ignore me. let's move on
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
Yes please.
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
Next issue on the agenda is communications issues.
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
We need to decide to stick with p2 or not. Avoid fracturing like we have.
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
Also if our workflow in GitHub is good or not.
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
We have a lot of stuff happening with out an issue, which makes it hard to track.
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
does anyone have a link to an article about P2 usage? at automattic or Woo?
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
@yoren posted some on the p2.
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
I just added that post earlier
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
yoren provided several
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
I’d like to propose that with GitHub we stick to everything gets an issue. No commits without an open issue.
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
I think that might help us define the usage of P2 and GitHub
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
i've used this it is not wordpress but good
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
http://sourceforge.net/projects/allocpsa/
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
@yoren Yes.
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
The GitHub issue is by per project
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
I think if we stick to big decsions on p2, indvidual discussions by issue in GitHub we will be fine.
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
if anything is not a project yet, like we'd like to brainstorming, that will go to P2
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
The breakdowns I see are discussions about the project in GitHub issues, like when I asked for this meeting in an issue in GitHub [:blush:]
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
right
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
i have a demo link if anyone wants it
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
lets go with that and evaluate it in a few weeks again.
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
I don’t think we have a tech issue really.
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
yes. we just need to build a habit
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
I think if we stick to the system with what we have we will be ok.
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
@yoren Exactly.
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
a habit for the team so we know where can find what
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
@caramiame I think we should stick with WP or hosted stuff so we do not need to maintain infrastructure
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
k
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
I'll suggest we install the Houston for a better P2
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
And stick to it. Stick to everything gets an issue, even if its a small thing, or it will be to hard to track.
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
@yoren Me too, but I don’t know if wp.com supports it.
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
Only Slobodon has access to that backend.
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
did you guys check that? I think I could sold some problem we've met
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
did you see yoren's link about woo using it on multisite
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
It’s superior.
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
I could try on my wordpress.com account first
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
Well maybe we should be self-hosting the p2.
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
how do you get notification for the P2?
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
defnitely
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
if not, just skip it. P2 won't be so bad
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
i thought that is what we were going to do
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
mail?
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
Having p2 on wp.com makes life easy.
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
self hosting
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
yes mail
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
@cfoellmann you'd like a way more than mail?
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
via https://wordpress.com/notifications/ ?
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
you use that with multisite
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
nope. I just follow the blog for new post (and comments I guess)
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
Leaving it on wpcom makes life easier. I’m not sure I want to complicate matters.
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
I’d rather just consentrate on making new plugins.
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
Yes we'll just keep it on wp.com
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
no need to host it. if houston can't be install, it's fine
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
The Huston theme is nice, but I’m not sure it’s worth it for that to move.
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
OK let’s move on then.
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
can't you back up? i have space
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
anything else @cfoellmann?
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
k
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
not from my side
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
Let’s discuss what our next project is.
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
good
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
Are we sure we want to do the Trello Plugin, should we do multiple things?
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
Something else?
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
I think the trello plugin might not work smoothly for the lack of API
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
Things we can do is limited
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
Yah, once we considered the API the scope got rather boring.
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
yeah
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
I think if we would use Trello for WPCollab it would be ok but...
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
Multiple projects: YES
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
asana seemed good
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
@cfoellmann Made a nice list of the proposals int he agenda.
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
I like the octocard @cfoellmann mentioned on the other day
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
i saw that too
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
that would be nice for our site, too
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
I liked the Octocard plugin.
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
keep the project moving
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
I’ve been meaning to find an excuse to learn to work with GitHub API.
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
If we feel get stuck, like brainstorming the Trello plugin, we should skip the idea for now
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
How about creating a "core" GitHub plugin with addons for Octocard?
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
what do you mean "core"?
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
@cfoellmann You mean a core GitHub API integration plugin?
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
Beacuse I can think of several nice add-ons.
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
communicate WP with GitHub?
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
do you guys ever do payment mods
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
I’ve always wanted to have a bbPress plugin that can link threads to issues in GitHub for support forums.
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
Core would mean auth and SDK setup without frontend functionalities
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
@caramiame What do you mean?
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
and then addons extending it and using the connections provided by the core plugin
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
i had an idea but may not fit here
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
do you mean for payment gateways or paid plugins?
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
that sounds neat
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
it would be paid probably

i dunno
caramiame

a plug in for ach transfers with router numbers and bank account -- too messy?
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
@cfoellmann I think this is a good idea.
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
The octocard is a good simple project for first add-on.
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
I myself have nothing against paid open-source software. Paying for a lot each year.
We were talking about doing a "premium" plugin some time in the future @caramiame
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
yes
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
i see a need for it
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
@yoren What do you think about this GitHub integration plugins idea?
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
@Shelob9 maybe we could contact the dev of the script and the server. Get him on board
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
Which script?
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
i didn't know it was out there
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
@Shelob9 octocard
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
Oh ok.
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
Yes, for that add-on.
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
or we create a PHP implementation
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
-> more work
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
Right, now I follow you.
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
but no dependency on node-js
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
I like the core GitHub idea
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
It sounds like @Shelob9 and I are down for starting a GitHub Connector plugin aímed for extensibility
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
cool
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
@cfoellmann Yes.
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
So two projects then- A core GitHub API plugin and the OctoCard add on.
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
Umm...
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
ok
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
@yoren What?
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
nope. ignore my umm
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
I would love to pick up one more project independent from the GitHub stuff
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
@cfoellmann Arn’t you worried about stretching ourselves too thin?
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
I don’t have a ton of time right now.
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
So the next project is core GitHub API, and the octocard add-on?
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
We’re already doing a lot.
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
@yoren That’s the proposal.
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
like I wrote in the agenda: Projects go through phases. A frontend dev comes in later and has nothing to do in the beginning other than testing
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
@cfoellmann Right.
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
I was thinking the octocard would be a easier one, but now we'll do the core GitHub API first, right?
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
I do not want to stretch too thin, too
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
But why don’t we get started on the GitHub stuff and see where we are in a week or two?
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
@yoren The Octocard is an add-on for the core plugin.
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
good idea @Shelob9. just what I wanted to say right now [:smile:]
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
ok
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
I’d love to do all the things right now. But I’ve got a ton of client work to do as well.
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
yes
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
Trying to be realistic.
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
@yoren Octocard in its current version is dependent on node-js or the external service (node-js) to cache the API calls
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
oh. Now I got it.
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
We need to figure out the core plugin before we figure out Octocard.
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
if we do a "proper" Octocard implementation for WP + PHP we would need the connection to the GH API and that would be provided by the "Core Plugin"
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
So how may I help you with the core GitHub API? or you could do it on your own?
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
@yoren Let’s think of Octocard as the test/ proof of concept for the core plugin.
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
ok. I got it.
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
It will show how to use the core plugin for a specific task.
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
yes
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
I’d imagine we will have a class called add_on or something that add-on plugins will extend.
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
after our core is "stable" we could ask other devs with GitHub plugins utilizing the API to migrate to an addon for our core
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
good idea
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
For example, at Pods we have this class: https://github.com/pods-framework/pods/blob/2.x/classes/PodsComponents.php
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
the core is more or less an abstraction layer for the addons to use the API, right?
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
It’s purpose is to be extended to create add-ons.
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
@cfoellmann Exactly.
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
cool
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
@cfoellmann exactly.
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
Yes- we should "steal" as much from quality projects as possible [:imp:]
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
hahaha
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
Share.
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
Share with your neighbor, it’s what the 2nd freedom is there for.
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
hah
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
[:blush:]
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
I thought there were none left in the US [:fire:]
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
haha
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
ha
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
lol
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
@Shelob9 no offense. Just a joke
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
Not offending me.
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
[:blush:]
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
lets just find a slug for the core to init the repo - for issues and stuff
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
wp-github-core?
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
Well wpcollab prefix
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
Maybe a more symbolic name.
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
can't be just wp-github?
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
Morannon?
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
wp-github is free. http://wpseek.com/pluginslugcheck/
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
I think Otto has banned wp-pluginname plugins.
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
I could be wrong.
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
ok
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
But I think he wants new plugins to not use that prefix.
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
but in our case it would make sense
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
wpcollab-wp-github on WP.ORG?
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
github-api
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
wp-github-collab
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
I think prefixing the slug with wpcollab is not necessary
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
k
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
its not like it describes the functionality or prevents conflicts
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
ok
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
github-o-matic
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
Think of the fun retro logo!
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
yes
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
style it like this http://hubot.github.com/
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
Now we’re talking!!
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
that's good
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3

3

caramiame

3

Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3

cfoellmann

Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
gitpress-bot is nice.
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
If this takes of we will be pressed to add Git/GitLab/Bitbucket support in the future
Shelob9

3

3
I think we have a winner.
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
so the name gets 4 vote.
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
I also think we should wrap up this meeting. We’re almost at two hours.
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
yes
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
yeah
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
OK cool. So let’s open a new repo for gitpress-bot and start adding start scoping it.
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
Cool?
caramiame
• February 17 2014
3
cool they left tho
caramiame
• February 17 2014

Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
I can write a wrap-up of this meeting later on today (I’m at 9AM right now) if someone does it first, all the better.
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
Yes, next chat more focus on gitbot.
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
ok
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
gitpress-bot
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
We should discuss on p2 if we want to do regular chats or not. That question can go in the wrap-up?
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
yes please
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
Yes gitpress-bot
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
I can create the repo and the new team for gitpress-bot
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
do that.
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
Awsome.
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
But let’s wait till we have scoped the project out before starting on code, OK?
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
doing now.
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
yes. just opening issues for now
yoren
• February 17 2014
3
yes of course. just create the repo first
Shelob9

3
Yes.
yoren
• February 17 2014
3

Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
Let’s use the issue tracker to figure out the scope and the first few milestones like we did with hello emoji.
Shelob9
• February 17 2014
3
Can we declare meeting #1 a great success and completed?
cfoellmann
• February 17 2014
3
anyone of the frontend people interested in extending my https://github.com/cfoellmann/github-1440-plus style with me
caramiame

cfoellmann

cfoellmann

3
@Shelob9 yes. Good start. another milestone
